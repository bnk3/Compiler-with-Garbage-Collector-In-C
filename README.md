# Dynamic Typed Object-Oriented Language Compiler with Garbage Collector In C
Features

1. Two-Phase Compilation Process
Front-end: The compiler parses source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) through lexical analysis (tokenization) and syntax analysis (parsing).
Back-end: The AST is compiled into bytecode, a lower-level, compact, and portable representation of the program that the virtual machine can execute efficiently.
2. Bytecode Generation
The compiler produces bytecode as output, enabling easier interpretation by the virtual machine. Bytecode provides a simplified, optimized format for code execution and is more compact than raw source code.
3. Stack-Based Virtual Machine
The VM utilizes a stack-based architecture to execute the generated bytecode. Instructions operate on values stored in the stack, allowing for simple and fast arithmetic, logical operations, and function calls.
4. Simple Instruction Set
The VM supports a concise set of instructions, including loading values onto the stack, performing arithmetic operations, handling control flow (e.g., jumps and conditionals), and managing function calls.
5. Garbage Collection
A garbage collector is integrated to manage memory efficiently, automatically reclaiming unused memory and preventing memory leaks during execution.
6. Error Handling
The compiler handles errors at different stages:
Syntax errors: Detected during parsing in the front-end.
Runtime errors: Occur during bytecode execution in the virtual machine (e.g., illegal operations or memory access violations).
7. Optimized for Performance
The bytecode format and VM are designed for efficient execution. The stack-based operations, simple instruction set, and garbage collection mechanisms provide optimal performance, minimizing memory overhead and execution time.
